# Splitter
Ethereum Developer Course - Project 1 - Splitter

----------Task

You will create a smart contract named Splitter whereby:

there are 3 people: Alice, Bob and Carol.
we can see the balance of the Splitter contract on the Web page.
whenever Alice sends ether to the contract for it to be split, half of it goes to Bob and the other half to Carol.
we can see the balances of Alice, Bob and Carol on the Web page.
Alice can use the Web page to split her ether.
We purposely left a lot to be decided. Such description approximates how your human project sponsors would describe the rules. As the Ethereum Smart Contract specialist, you have to think things through.
